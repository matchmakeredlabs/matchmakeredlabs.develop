# A Note from MatchMaker's CEO

MatchMakerâ€™s Mission is heartfelt and simple:

<div class="text-center" style="text-decoration: BOLD;">Liberate Learning!</div>

<br/>At MatchMaker Educaion Labs we are committed to each and every learner reaching their full potential and achieving their career dreams. As this goal clearly requires institutions, schools as well as companies, to better meet the unique needs of each learner (school or job applicant/candidate/student). Hence, MatchMaker consciously chose to enable institutions across the Competency-based Learning Industry (CBLI) to do better in terms of meeting learners needs while simultaneously acknowledging what they already know.<br/>
